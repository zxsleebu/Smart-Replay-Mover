  ## ✨ Why Smart Replay Mover?

  Stop messing with Python installations, libraries, and version conflicts. Smart Replay Mover is a **native Lua script** designed for maximum performance and ease of use.

  Unlike other scripts that rely solely on OBS internal hooks, this tool uses **Windows API (via FFI)** to intelligently detect what you're actually playing. This ensures your clips land in the right folder every time—even with Display Capture, Borderless modes, or Anti-Cheat systems.

  <div align="center">

  | ❌ Before | ✅ After |
  |-----------|----------|
  | All clips in one messy folder | Organized by game automatically |
  | Manual sorting after each session | Set and forget |
  | No idea when clip was saved | Visual + sound notifications |

  </div>

  ## 🎮 Custom Names

  Three powerful matching modes for any situation:

  ### Exact Match
  CS2 > Counter-Strike 2
  Maps process name directly to folder name.

  ### Keywords Mode
  +Warhammer Marine > Space Marine 2
  Matches if **all** keywords are present (AND logic). Prefix with `+`.

  ### Contains Mode
  Space Marine 2 > Space Marine 2
  Matches if text is found **anywhere** in process name or window title. Wrap in `*`.

  > 💡 **Pro Tip:** Contains mode is perfect for games with version numbers that change with updates!

  ### Examples

  | Custom Name | What It Matches |
  |-------------|-----------------|
  | `r5apex > Apex Legends` | Process `r5apex.exe` |
  | `+Warhammer Space > WH40K` | Any window containing both words |
  | `*Cyberpunk* > Cyberpunk 2077` | `Cyberpunk 2077 v2.1 Patch...` |

  ## 🔊 Custom Notification Sound

  1. Find a short sound file (1-2 seconds recommended)
  2. Convert to **WAV format** if needed
  3. Rename to `notification_sound.wav`
  4. Place in the same folder as the script:

  ```
  📁 Your Folder/
  ├── Smart Replay Mover.lua
  └── notification_sound.wav
  ```

  5. Reload the script — done!

  ---

  ## 📂 Output Structure

  The script creates this folder structure automatically:

  ```
  📁 Videos/
  ├── 📁 Counter-Strike 2/
  │   ├── CS2 - 2025-06-15 14-30-01.mp4
  │   └── CS2 - 2025-06-15 14-35-22.png
  │
  ├── 📁 Valorant/
  │   └── Valorant - 2025-06-16 20-10-55.mp4
  │
  ├── 📁 Space Marine 2/
  │   └── Space Marine 2 - 2025-06-17 18-45-00.mp4
  │
  └── 📁 Desktop/
      └── Desktop - 2025-06-17 09-00-00.mp4
  ```

  ## ❓ Troubleshooting

  ### Clips save to "Desktop" instead of game folder?

  Some games with **anti-cheat protection** (Easy Anti-Cheat, Vanguard, etc.) block the script from reading the process name. If the game isn't in our built-in list, it will fall back to "Desktop".

  **Solution:** Add a Custom Name mapping:

  1. Open OBS → Tools → Scripts → Click on the script
  2. In **CUSTOM NAMES** section, enter:
     - Game: `*Your Game Name*` (with asterisks)
     - Folder: `Your Game Name`
  3. Click **Add**

  **Examples:**
  | Game | Folder |
  |------|--------|
  | `*Sea of Thieves*` | `Sea of Thieves` |
  | `*New World*` | `New World` |
  | `*PUBG*` | `PUBG` |

  > 💡 The `*pattern*` mode matches the window title, which works even when anti-cheat blocks process detection!
