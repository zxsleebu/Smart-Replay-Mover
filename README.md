  ## ✨ Why Smart Replay Mover?

  Stop messing with Python installations, libraries, and version conflicts. Smart Replay Mover is a **native Lua script** designed for maximum performance and ease of use.

  Unlike other scripts that rely solely on OBS internal hooks, this tool uses **Windows API (via FFI)** to intelligently detect what you're actually playing. This ensures your clips land in the right folder every time—even with Display Capture, Borderless modes, or Anti-Cheat systems.

  <div align="center">

  | ❌ Before | ✅ After |
  |-----------|----------|
  | All clips in one messy folder | Organized by game automatically |
  | Manual sorting after each session | Set and forget |
  | No idea when clip was saved | Visual + sound notifications |

  </div>

  ## 🎮 Custom Names

  Three powerful matching modes for any situation:

  ### Exact Match
  CS2 > Counter-Strike 2
  Maps process name directly to folder name.

  ### Keywords Mode
  +Warhammer Marine > Space Marine 2
  Matches if **all** keywords are present (AND logic). Prefix with `+`.

  ### Contains Mode
  `*Space Marine 2* > Space Marine 2`
  Matches if text is found **anywhere** in process name or window title. Wrap in `*`.

  > 💡 **Pro Tip:** Contains mode is perfect for games with version numbers that change with updates!

  ### Examples

  | Custom Name | What It Matches |
  |-------------|-----------------|
  | `r5apex > Apex Legends` | Process `r5apex.exe` |
  | `+Warhammer Space > WH40K` | Any window containing both words |
  | `*Cyberpunk* > Cyberpunk 2077` | `Cyberpunk 2077 v2.1 Patch...` |

  ## 🔊 Custom Notification Sound

  1. Find a short sound file (1-2 seconds recommended)
  2. Convert to **WAV format** if needed
  3. Rename to `notification_sound.wav`
  4. Place in the same folder as the script:

  ```
  📁 Your Folder/
  ├── Smart Replay Mover.lua
  └── notification_sound.wav
  ```

  5. Reload the script — done!

  ### 🔇 Quiet Sound Option (v2.7.7+)
  
  If the standard sound is too loud, you can use a separate "quiet" sound file:
  
  1. Prepare a quieter sound file.
  2. Name it `notification_sound_silent.wav`.
  3. Place it in the same folder.
  4. In script settings, check **"Use Quiet Sound"**.
  
  Now you can toggle between the Normal and Quiet versions instantly!

  ## 📂 Output Structure

  The script creates this folder structure automatically:

  ```
  📁 Videos/
  ├── 📁 Counter-Strike 2/
  │   ├── CS2 - 2025-06-15 14-30-01.mp4
  │   └── CS2 - 2025-06-15 14-35-22.png
  │
  ├── 📁 Valorant/
  │   └── Valorant - 2025-06-16 20-10-55.mp4
  │
  ├── 📁 Space Marine 2/
  │   └── Space Marine 2 - 2025-06-17 18-45-00.mp4
  │
  └── 📁 Desktop/
      └── Desktop - 2025-06-17 09-00-00.mp4
  ```

  ## ❓ Troubleshooting

  ### 🛑 Nothing happens when I test?
  
  **IMPORTANT:** The script detects the **Active Window** (what you are currently looking at).
  
  - If you Alt-Tab to OBS to change settings -> The script sees "OBS Studio".
  - Since OBS is in the ignores list, the script does nothing.
  
  **How to Test Properly:**
  1. Set up your Custom Names.
  2. **Alt-Tab back into the game.**
  3. Wait 3-5 seconds.
  4. Save a Replay.
  5. Check the folder.

  ---

  ### Clips save to "Desktop" instead of game folder?

  Some games with **anti-cheat protection** (Easy Anti-Cheat, Vanguard, etc.) block the script from reading the process name. If the game isn't in our built-in list, it will fall back to "Desktop".

  **Solution:** Add a Custom Name mapping:

  1. Open OBS → Tools → Scripts → Click on the script
  2. In **CUSTOM NAMES** section, enter:
     - Game: `*Your Game Name*` (with asterisks)
     - Folder: `Your Game Name`
  3. Click **Add**

  **Examples:**
  | Game | Folder | Type |
  |------|--------|------|
  | `*Sea of Thieves*` | Sea of Thieves | Matches Window Title |
  | `*New World*` | New World | Matches Window Title |
  | `*PUBG*` | PUBG | Matches Window Title |

  > 💡 **CRITICAL TIP:** When using `*pattern*`, you are matching the **WINDOW TITLE**, not the .exe name!
  > 
  > - ❌ `*cs2*` -> Won't work because the window is named "Counter-Strike 2" (doesn't contain "cs2").
  > - ✅ `*Counter-Strike*` -> Works perfectly!
  > - ❌ `*FactoryGamesteam*` -> Won't work because window is named "Satisfactory".
  > - ✅ `*Satisfactory*` -> Works perfectly!

  The `*pattern*` mode matches the window title, which works even when anti-cheat blocks process detection!

  ## 🎞️ Video Thumbnails (FFmpeg)

  Enhance your clip library by embedding high-quality cover art into your videos. This allows Windows Explorer (and tools like [Icaros](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/icaros.html)) to display a frame from your gameplay as the file icon instead of a generic media player logo.

  ### 📥 1. Download FFmpeg
  1. Go to [gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) (recommended Windows builds).
  2. Download the `ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip`.
  3. Extract it to a permanent folder (e.g., `C:\Program Files\ffmpeg`).

  ### ⚙️ 2. Configuration in OBS
  1. Open OBS Studio → **Tools** → **Scripts**.
  2. Select **Smart Replay Mover**.
  3. Go to the **🎥 Advanced (FFmpeg)** section.
  4. Enable **"Enable Thumbnails"**.
  5. Click **Browse** for **FFmpeg Path** and select the `ffmpeg.exe` file (located inside the `bin` folder of your extraction).

  ### ✨ Benefits
  - **Silent & Invisible** — FFmpeg runs completely in the background without popups.
  - **No Quality Loss** — Metadata is embedded without re-encoding your video.
  - **Universal Compatibility** — Works with both MKV (attachments) and MP4 (tags).
